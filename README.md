# ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis for Market DataHereâ€™s a concise, professional description you can put at the top of your GitHub README:

**StockStats-Py**
A Python toolkit for statistical analysis of stock market data.

This repository provides a collection of ready-to-use functions and Jupyter notebooks for:
* **Data ingestion** via [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) â€” download daily close prices, compute prior-day closes and daily returns
* **Confidence intervals** (one-sample, two-sample) at arbitrary confidence levels
* **Hypothesis tests** (Welchâ€™s t-test, paired t-test, proportion tests)
* **Performance metrics** (Sharpe ratio, volatility estimation, moving averages)
* **Helper utilities** for data cleaning, visualization, and result reporting
**Why use StockStats-Py?**
* Drop-in functions (`def compute_confidence_interval(...)`, `def welch_ttest(...)`, etc.) you can paste directly into your notebook
* Clear, well-documented code with minimal dependencies (NumPy, pandas, SciPy, matplotlib)
* Designed for quantitative finance projects, coursework, and internship portfolios
**Getting Started**
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib yfinance
   ```
3. Open any notebook in `/notebooks/` and follow the examples
